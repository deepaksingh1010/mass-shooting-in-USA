# mass-shooting-in-USA
Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of mass shootings in the United States from 2014 to 2023, leveraging data from the Gun Violence Archive. Through methodical web scraping and database integration, we aim to uncover patterns related to gun culture, firearm accessibility, and the occurrence of mass shootings. Our goal is to contribute meaningful insights to the discourse on gun control and preventive measures.

Background
With a unique and complex relationship to firearms, the United States has seen its share of tragic mass shootings. This project delves into the implications of gun culture on public safety and seeks to identify patterns and insights that could aid in developing effective strategies to mitigate gun-related violence.

Data Sources
The primary source of our data is the Gun Violence Archive, which offers detailed reports on gun-related incidents, including mass shootings, across the United States. This comprehensive and up-to-date resource has been instrumental in our analysis.

Methodology
Data Collection
Our data was meticulously gathered through a web-scraping routine utilizing Selenium and BeautifulSoup. This combination allowed us to navigate complex website structures and dynamically interact with web pages to collect detailed information on mass shootings.

Data Analysis
We integrated our collected data into a MySQL database, designed to facilitate a multi-dimensional analysis of the incidents. This structure enables us to examine trends and patterns across different states and over time.
